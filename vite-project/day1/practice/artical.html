            <h2>Technology promotes meaningful interactions</h2>
            <p>Through collaborative internet tools, online teachers plan group activities and projects for students. These synchronous
                classes are also great for the development of the social domains of a student.<br>
                Students in a recognized online school, communicate with their peers and gain an understanding through group interactions. <br>
                Such meaningful discussions through these internet tools improve the knowledge base of students, thereby enhancing their
                 learning experiences.</p>
